    "In reinforcement learning an `agent` is introduced to an environment which has a set of rules and objectives. The agent is initially unaware of these rules. The agent is however able to experience the environment, i.e. it is able to observe the `state` of the environment. Based on the state the agent is required to take some `action` from a predetermined set of `actions`. These actions would in-turn change the `state` of the environment and the cycle continues.\n",
    "\n",
    "Some `actions` would sometime lead to a positive outcome(target objective) and some other time it may lead to negative outcome. The environment is coded as such that when a positive outcome occurs a `reward` is handed to the agent and the agent is required to try and maximise this `reward`. Contrary a `penalty` is incurred when the outcome is undesired.\n",

    "Eventually, the `agent` learns its environment and is able to perform task efficiently."
