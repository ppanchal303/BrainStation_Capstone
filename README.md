Hello Reader! 

This is a ReadMe file for the capstone project of Pranav Panchal, submitted for BrainStation Data Science Bootcamp Jul-Sept, 2022.

Capstone Submission Package

The BrainStation_Capstone folder contains:
1 ReadMe file,
1 Font file,
1 Packages and Importation file,
1 Capstone_Report folder that contains the submission report,
3 Jupyter Notebooks, 
5 scripts.  

Steps to follow:
- Setup the python environment using the env_export.yml file provided.
- You must run all scripts and notebooks in this new environment.
- Ensure the structure of the scripts within the folder is unchanged. This is essential for correctly runnning the game environments.
- There is no separate data for this capstone project.


All this to be checked before running the first notebook. 


The 3 Jupyter Notebook files are independent of each other, however, the flow of information is understood well if they are consumed in the following order:

1_Basic Reinforcement Learning Algorithm 

2_Exploration of OpenAI Gym 

3_Q-Learning Implementation on Snake Game
